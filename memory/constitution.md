# Ottawa Webmasters Constitution

<!-- Professional web development agency specializing in modern web solutions -->

## Core Principles

### I. Component-First Development

**Component Architecture Priority**: Every UI feature starts as a reusable Vue component; Components must be self-contained, independently testable, and well-documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only components; Follow Vue 3 Composition API standards.

### II. SEO & Performance First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Search Engine Optimization Mandatory**: Every page must include proper meta tags, structured data, and semantic HTML; Core Web Vitals must meet Google standards; Mobile-first responsive design enforced; Performance budgets strictly monitored with Lighthouse audits.

### III. Test-Driven Development

**Quality Assurance Required**: Unit tests with Vitest for all utility functions and composables; End-to-end testing with Playwright for critical user flows; Visual regression testing for UI components; All tests must pass before deployment.

### IV. Accessibility & Inclusivity

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All components must support keyboard navigation; Color contrast ratios must meet accessibility standards; Screen reader compatibility required; Alt text mandatory for all images; Focus management implemented properly.

### V. Modern Technology Stack

**Nuxt.js Framework Standard**: Vue 3 with Composition API for reactive interfaces; Tailwind CSS for consistent styling; TypeScript integration for type safety when needed; Pinia for state management; Modern ES modules throughout.

## Technology Standards

### Development Environment

- **Framework**: Nuxt.js 4.x with Vue 3 Composition API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Testing**: Vitest for units, Playwright for E2E
- **Linting**: ESLint with Vue-specific rules, Oxlint for performance
- **Formatting**: Prettier with consistent configuration
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics and Microsoft Clarity integration
- **SEO**: Structured data, meta management, sitemap generation

### Code Quality Requirements

- All code must pass ESLint and Oxlint checks
- 80%+ test coverage for business logic
- Performance budgets: < 3s load time, > 90 Lighthouse score
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Planning**: Create feature specification in `/templates/spec-template.md`
2. **Branch Creation**: Use feature branch naming: `feature/description`
3. **Component Development**: Build reusable components in `/components`
4. **Page Integration**: Implement pages using component composition
5. **SEO Implementation**: Add meta tags, structured data, accessibility
6. **Testing**: Write and run all required tests
7. **Review**: Code review focusing on performance and accessibility
8. **Deployment**: Automated deployment via Vercel with preview builds

### Quality Gates

- All ESLint rules must pass without warnings
- Lighthouse score > 90 for Performance, Accessibility, SEO
- Core Web Vitals within green thresholds
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness verified across device sizes
- A11y compliance verified with screen readers

### Content Management

- Blog content managed through `/data/blogs.json`
- SEO checklists maintained in `/data/seoChecklistData.js`
- Portfolio projects documented with case studies
- Client testimonials and reviews integrated
- Regular content audits for accuracy and relevance

## Governance

**Constitution Authority**: This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines; All feature development and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles; Complexity must be justified with clear business value and technical necessity.

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require documentation of rationale, approval from lead developer, and migration plan for existing code; Use `/memory/constitution_update_checklist.md` for change tracking.

**Development Guidance**: Follow `/scripts/` automation for consistent workflows; Use `/templates/` for standardized documentation; Reference `/UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md` for visual consistency.
